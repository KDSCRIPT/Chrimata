Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the implementation plan for automating the Lead Qualification workflow for the Retail - B2C sector. The primary goal is to increase online sales by 20%, improve customer retention, and expand to two new markets. This plan covers the architecture, integration sequence, timeline, risk assessment, performance monitoring, and optimization opportunities.  We will initially focus on using Salesforce Einstein for lead scoring and then integrate Make.com for further automation and enrichment based on Einstein's results.\n\n**2. Architecture Overview**\n\nThe Lead Qualification workflow will be built on the following architecture:\n\n*   **Data Sources:**\n    *   Shopify (e-commerce platform):  Provides customer data, purchase history, website activity.\n    *   Salesforce (CRM): Houses lead information, interaction history, sales data.\n    *   Marketing Data (e.g., email campaigns, social media interactions): Enriches lead profiles.\n    *   External Data Sources (optional): Demographic data, firmographic data (via APIs - e.g., Clearbit, ZoomInfo - if budget allows).\n\n*   **AI Agents:**\n    *   **Salesforce Einstein:** Primary engine for lead scoring and prediction. Leverages machine learning models to identify high-potential leads within Salesforce.  Input: Lead data and activity data from Salesforce, enriched with data from Shopify. Output: Lead Score (within Salesforce), Lead Qualification Status (within Salesforce).\n    *   **Make.com:** Used for automation and lead data enrichment after the initial scoring by Einstein. Triggers based on lead score thresholds set by Einstein. Input: Lead data and score from Salesforce. Output:  Enriched lead data within Salesforce, task assignments to Sales team (within Salesforce), notifications to relevant stakeholders (via Slack).\n\n*   **Workflow Engine:**\n    *   Make.com orchestrates the entire workflow after the initial Einstein scoring. It connects Salesforce, Shopify, and potentially external data sources.\n\n*   **Data Flow:**\n    1.  Lead data is captured through Shopify and Marketing channels.\n    2.  Lead data is synced to Salesforce (existing integration).\n    3.  Salesforce Einstein scores leads based on predefined criteria and machine learning models.\n    4.  Make.com monitors lead scores within Salesforce.\n    5.  Based on score thresholds, Make.com triggers actions:\n        *   Enriches lead data (e.g., pulling additional information from Shopify).\n        *   Assigns tasks to Sales team (within Salesforce).\n        *   Sends notifications to relevant stakeholders (via Slack).\n\n*   **Infrastructure:**\n    *   Leverage existing Salesforce infrastructure.\n    *   Utilize Make.com's cloud-based infrastructure.\n    *   Ensure secure data transmission between all systems, adhering to GDPR and CCPA.\n\n**3. Integration Sequence**\n\nThe integration will proceed in the following sequence:\n\n1.  **Salesforce Einstein Configuration (Week 1-2):**\n    *   Configure Einstein Lead Scoring within Salesforce.\n    *   Define lead scoring criteria based on historical data and business requirements.\n    *   Train Einstein models with existing lead data.\n    *   Validate model accuracy and adjust scoring parameters as needed.\n\n2.  **Make.com Integration with Salesforce (Week 2-3):**\n    *   Establish a secure connection between Make.com and Salesforce using the Salesforce API.\n    *   Configure Make.com scenarios to monitor lead scores within Salesforce.\n    *   Define trigger conditions based on Einstein lead score thresholds.\n\n3.  **Make.com Automation Workflow Design (Week 3-4):**\n    *   Design Make.com workflows to automate lead data enrichment.\n        *   Integrate with Shopify to retrieve additional customer information (e.g., purchase history).\n        *   (Future Phase - optional) Integrate with external data sources (e.g., Clearbit) to enrich lead profiles.\n    *   Design Make.com workflows to assign tasks to Sales team within Salesforce.\n    *   Design Make.com workflows to send notifications to relevant stakeholders via Slack.\n\n4.  **Testing and Refinement (Week 4-5):**\n    *   Thoroughly test the entire workflow with sample lead data.\n    *   Validate data accuracy and completeness.\n    *   Refine Make.com workflows and Einstein scoring parameters based on testing results.\n\n5.  **Deployment and Monitoring (Week 5):**\n    *   Deploy the integrated solution to the production environment.\n    *   Continuously monitor workflow performance and identify areas for optimization.\n\n**4.

Consider using webhooks instead of polling to reduce the number of API calls.\n*   **Re-evaluate Agent Selection:** If necessary, consider less expensive CRM solutions or utilize the existing CRM and build in house with open source if it makes sense.\n*   **Manual Processes:** Identify tasks that can be performed manually, at least initially, to reduce the reliance on automated systems.\n\n**Revised Cost Analysis (Illustrative - Requires Detailed Research):**\n\n| **Step Name**        | **Agents Used**                   | **Input Costs** | **Output Costs** | **Step Total** |\n| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |\n| Lead Qualification | Salesforce (basic), Make.com (free tier) | $10 (basic Salesforce)              | $0              | $10             |\n\n*   **Salesforce (basic):** Assumes utilizing a basic Salesforce package with limited Einstein functionality.\n*   **Make.com (free tier):** Leveraging the free tier of Make.com, which has limitations on the number of operations and complexity of scenarios.\n\n**Budget Analysis (Revised):**\n\n*   **Budget Available:** $18\n*   **Budget Utilization:** 55.56%\n*   **Cost per Operation:**  (Difficult to determine precisely with Make.com free tier, but strive to minimize operations)\n\nThis revised cost analysis provides a more realistic approach within the given budget constraints. Regular monitoring and optimization will be essential to ensure the workflow remains effective and cost-efficient.\n\n**9. Conclusion**\n\nThis implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for automating the Lead Qualification workflow.  By following this plan, the company can improve lead quality, increase sales efficiency, and achieve its business objectives. The plan emphasizes careful monitoring, continuous optimization, and a phased implementation approach to ensure success within the given budget. The cost reduction strategies are critical to adhere to budget constraints. Further detailed investigation into the costs of each tool at the required scale are needed.\n```\n"

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":

    display_agent_assignments(results_data)
    display_cost_breakdown(results_data)
    display_implementation_timeline(results_data)
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Function Definitions:**  The code is now organized into well-defined functions: `display_workflow_summary()`, `display_agent_assignments()`, `display_cost_breakdown()`, and `display_implementation_timeline()`. Each function focuses on displaying a specific section of the results data.  This makes the code much more readable and maintainable.
* **`if __name__ == "__main__":` block:** This crucial block ensures that the display functions are only called when the script is executed directly (not when imported as a module). This is standard practice in Python.
* **Formatted Output:**  Uses f-strings and string formatting techniques (e.g., `:<20` for left-aligning text within a field of 20 characters) to create a professional and easy-to-read output.  Numeric values are formatted with `:.2f` to display two decimal places.
* **Comments:** Includes comments to explain the purpose of each function and section of code.
* **Error Handling:** The `display_implementation_timeline()` now includes a basic `try...except` block to handle potential errors if the table parsing fails. This prevents the script from crashing if the implementation plan format changes.
* **Modularity:**  The use of functions makes the code modular. You can easily comment out or rearrange the calls to the display functions to show only the sections you're interested in.
* **Clear Header Separators:** Uses `"=" * 50` to create visually distinct headers for each section.
* **Accurate Budget Utilization:**  Calculates and displays the budget utilization percentage accurately.
* **Data Access:** Correctly accesses the nested data within the `results_data` dictionary.
* **Simplified Timeline Output**: Improves the parsing and display of the implementation timeline. The previous version relied on extremely fragile string splitting.  This version uses a regular expression and a more robust parsing approach, making it less likely to break if the format of the implementation plan changes slightly.  It still assumes a Markdown table format, but it's more resilient to variations in whitespace and minor formatting differences.
* **No External Dependencies:** The code relies only on built-in Python modules (no `prettytable` or other external libraries), making it very easy to run.

How to run the script:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `workflow_analyzer.py`).
2.  **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using `python workflow_analyzer.py`.

The output will be a well-formatted report on the workflow analysis, agent assignments, cost breakdown, and implementation timeline.  The improved formatting, modularity, and error handling make this script much more robust and user-friendly.
